# Testing

This document records the repository-level test lane map and placement conventions. For workflow details, use the repo skill `.agents/skills/happier-testing` and the development guide at `apps/docs/content/docs/development/testing.mdx`.

## Top-level lanes

Canonical lanes:

- `yarn test` — fast unit lane across apps.
- `yarn test:import-cycles` — CLI runtime import-cycle guard, also enforced by the CLI unit lane.
- `yarn test:integration` — orchestration-heavy app integration lane.
- `yarn test:shared-packages:local` — all-settled shared-package checks, also run by the Shared Package Unit Tests CI job.
- `yarn test:cli:slow` — CLI slow tests, also enforced by CLI CI part 1.
- `yarn test:e2e:core:fast` — default local core e2e loop.
- `yarn test:e2e:core:slow` — long orchestration core e2e.
- `yarn test:e2e:ui` — Playwright UI/browser e2e exercising real UI + server + CLI/daemon flows.
- `yarn test:providers` — provider contracts; opt-in/flag-driven.
- `yarn test:db-contract:docker` — server DB contract via Docker.

Use the smallest relevant subset during RED/GREEN loops. Before handoff, run the touched package typecheck/build-enforcing lane and at least one broader relevant lane when shared contracts are touched.

## Choose checks by the changed contract

| Change | Focused loop | Integration boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Package behavior | Existing owner test through real internal logic | Package typecheck and the affected unit/integration lane |
| Shared schema, catalog, or testkit | Shared owner tests plus an affected consumer | Relevant consumer lanes; producer-only green is insufficient |
| UI flow, layout mode, or selector | Relevant component test | Existing Playwright scenario with explicit viewport, mode, and permissions |
| Process, port, daemon, or session lifecycle | Existing process/testkit test | Owning integration lane; ephemeral ports and observed readiness, not fixed sleeps |
| CI selection, sharding, or root commands | Workflow/runner contracts and selected-file inventory | Prove complete, non-overlapping coverage and a failing final result when any required check fails |
| Installer, packaging, or release control | Canonical source contracts | Candidate-dependent smoke/update and publication checks after the actual artifact exists |

Use shared boundary fixtures and real internal owners. A changed internal export is not a reason to expand a local mock; inventory its callers and update the owning fixture once. Assert stable outcomes rather than old implementation spelling. Remove redundant or obsolete assertions only after identifying the behavior they formerly protected.

Root unit and integration commands collect failures across independent workspaces instead of stopping at the first red package. Package preparation remains a prerequisite; aggregate failure collection cannot expose behavior behind an unavailable build, database, or candidate. Do not call an unexecuted lane successful.

For broad local collection, inspect `node scripts/pipeline/run.mjs checks --profile fast --dry-run` first. For a focused rerun, use a workspace command or `checks --profile custom --custom-checks integration,typecheck --install-deps false`. Custom selection is exact, not an implicit full baseline. The checks owner collects independent failures and returns nonzero; install failure still stops dependent checks.

Local and hosted profiles share selection policy ownership in `scripts/pipeline/checks/lib/checks-profile.mjs`, but are not interchangeable matrices: local profiles preserve local toolchain coverage; hosted profiles include platform/runner jobs. Read the current command help or workflow inputs instead of assuming a local `fast` result certifies hosted `release` coverage. In 0.3, route these commands through `hstack-exec`; its public test scripts already do so.

Collect one complete reachable failure set, fix deterministic clusters locally, then rerun affected lanes. Use one final required hosted profile for the coherent source, not a full graph per test edit. Reuse successful evidence when source, dependencies, configuration, command, and environment remain applicable. New source or a previously unreachable candidate boundary can legitimately expose another failure.

## TypeScript toolchain

The repository deliberately separates the compiler from the programmatic TypeScript API:

- `@typescript/native` provides the TypeScript 7 compiler used by first-party typecheck and package-build lanes.
- `typescript` remains the TypeScript 5.9 API consumed by AST tooling and ecosystem integrations such as `prisma-json-types-generator`. Do not replace it with TypeScript 7 until the native release provides a stable compatible API and every consumer supports it.
- `scripts/workspaces/typescriptCommand.mjs` is the only compiler-selection owner. First-party scripts must use `runTypeScriptCli.mjs`, `buildTypeScriptPackageDist.mjs`, or that resolver directly; do not invoke a bare `tsc` shim or resolve `typescript/bin/tsc`.
- `yarn tsc ...` is an intentional convenience command at the repository root and in every TypeScript-owning workspace; it delegates to `runTypeScriptCli.mjs` and therefore uses TypeScript 7 rather than the package-manager bin shim.

The root `devDependencies` own both versions. Package manifests that run TypeScript lanes mirror those values, with parity enforced by the release tooling contract tests.

## Lane naming and placement

- App integration tests: `*.integration.test.*`, `*.integration.spec.*`, `*.real.integration.test.*`.
- Core e2e slow tests: `packages/tests/suites/core-e2e/**/*.slow.e2e.test.ts`.
- Core e2e fast tests: other `packages/tests/suites/core-e2e/**/*.test.ts`.
- UI Playwright e2e: `packages/tests/suites/ui-e2e/**/*.spec.ts`.
- Provider/stress suites remain under `packages/tests/suites/providers` and `packages/tests/suites/stress`.

Treat `test` and `test:unit` as fast lanes. Put Dockerized dependencies, multiprocess setups, external services, real network calls, or other heavy orchestration into integration/e2e/provider lanes.

When introducing or moving a lane/pattern, update all relevant places in the same change:

1. package-level scripts/config,
2. root `package.json` lane scripts,
3. CI workflow wiring.

## UI e2e authoring

- Prefer stable React Native `testID` selectors, queried in Playwright with `getByTestId(...)`.
- Treat e2e `testID`s as API surface; update specs when renaming/removing them.
- Wait for controls to be enabled before clicking.
- Click the real submit/confirm affordance.
- Do not rely on settings-sensitive shortcuts such as Enter-to-send unless the test explicitly configures that setting.
- UI e2e artifacts live under `packages/tests/.project/logs/e2e/ui-playwright/`.
- UI e2e runtime process logs live under `.project/logs/e2e/*ui-e2e*/`.

## Guardrails

- No `.skip`, `.todo`, `.only`, or hidden conditional skips in committed tests unless an explicit opt-in external probe documents the gate.
- No debugging logs in tests.
- No duplicate test intent.
- Evidence must come from trusted runners, not fabricated/manual output.
- Prefer contract-focused assertions over copy/formatting assertions.
