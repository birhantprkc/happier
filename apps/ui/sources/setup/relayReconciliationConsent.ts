 *
 * A **relay** move is silent only when the facts prove the service is the app's own and is where
 * the app last put it:
 *
 * - **that is default-following** — `service.targetMode` says so, and it is asked of every
 *   installed service before anything else, running or stopped. That is the only mode whose
 *   contract is "track the selected default relay". A `pinned` service was deliberately fixed to
 *   one relay, and `null` means nothing proved a mode at all (an older CLI, or an unreadable
 *   definition); neither is evidence the app may move it, so both are asked about. This fact is
 *   required because the rest of the picture cannot supply it: an installed service whose running
 *   daemon its own installation owns looks identical whether it is pinned or following, so without
 *   the mode a remembered "always move my default-following service" could repoint a pinned one;
 * - **on the relay the app last expected**, compared through the corridor's one relay comparer;
 * - **with credentials the relay validated** — an unvalidated daemon proves nothing about where
 *   it belongs.
 *
 * A daemon already on the target relay, with no account contradiction, moves nowhere: the
 * executor converges it and the CLI's own dry-run raises any ownership consent (INV9).
 *
 * A manual, foreign-home, conflicting or multiple service is one this installation does not own at
 * all, so this function does not classify it: the executor's `service install --dry-run --json`
 * does, and raises the CLI's own consent (INV9). Restating that ownership policy here would put a
 * second, weaker decision in the UI.

 * Asked of the facts instead, the question has the same answer whether it is asked in the same run
