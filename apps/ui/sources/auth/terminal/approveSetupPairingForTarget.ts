/**
 * Approval of the desktop setup task's pairing request (plan R4 / INV2 / D3 / D4).
 *
 * This is the ONE helper that turns a `setup.thisComputer.v1` pairing prompt into an approved
 * request. Five binding checks are hard refusals, settled in this order before any credential is
 * read and before any human is asked:
 *
 *   1. the prompt was raised by the active setup task (not a stale or foreign task);
 *   2. the prompt's relay is exactly the relay the app sent the executor;
 *   3. the CLI's own identity for its configured relay is that same relay — the executor reports
 *      the comparable key the CLI ended up with, so an echo of the spec cannot stand in for it;
 *   4. the pairing is for the account this setup run is for — the executor states the
 *      `expectedAccountId` it was started with, and the response seals THAT account's content key,
 *      so a pairing raised for another account (or naming none) is refused before any read;
 *   5. the request does not demand v3 pairing — the prompt carries public material only (the
 *      pairing secret is redacted by design, A2), so a v3 or unknown requirement fails closed.
 *
 * Only after all five hold does install ownership decide HOW the pairing is approved. The
 * executor reports whether the CLI it drove came from this machine's desktop-managed install
 * layout or from an env/repo override. That is an ownership record, not a verified publisher
 * identity: the marker behind it is a plain text file under the user's own home (`current.version`,
 * `packages/cli-common/src/firstPartyRuntime/versionMarkers.ts`), so it says "this app's install
 * path put it there", never "this binary was cryptographically proven to be official Happier".
 * Ownership is still the right signal for choosing between two behaviours:
 *
 *   - **desktop-managed** — approve silently. First-run onboarding stays zero-interaction.
 *   - **anything else** — ask the human once, naming the resolved binary, through
 *     `confirmUnmanagedCli`. Accept approves; decline refuses by name. A caller with nobody to
 *     ask refuses outright. The same account content private key is already released, attended, to
 *     any CLI the user pairs by QR code (`useConnectTerminal`), so the invariant this preserves is
 *     narrower than "only official binaries": the app must not release the key UNATTENDED to a CLI
 *     its own install path did not place.
 *
 * Then, and only then: read the credentials stored for that exact target, seal a V2 response from
 * the account content private key, post it through `authApprove` addressed at that same relay
 * (`serverFetch` refuses the authenticated write if the relay is not the focused one), and answer
 * the task. The answer carries a boolean and a reason code — never a token, secret or path — and a
 * refusal is always answered so the executor fails with a named error instead of hanging (C6).
 *
 * Not `useConnectTerminal`: that hook switches the focused relay and shows modals unconditionally,
 * which is wrong for the silent managed path.
